      <h2>About Alexandria</h2>
      <p>
        Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE, Alexandria quickly became one
        of the most important cities in the ancient world, renowned for its
        unparalleled intellectual and cultural achievements. Today, Alexandria
        retains much of its storied past, with landmarks such as the Library of
        Alexandria and the Citadel of Qaitbay standing as testaments to its rich
        heritage. Visitors to Alexandria can explore its historic neighborhoods,
        including the UNESCO-listed Old Town, where narrow alleyways and
        medieval architecture evoke a sense of bygone eras. The city's bustling
        Corniche, a scenic waterfront promenade, offers stunning views of the
        Mediterranean Sea and is the perfect place to relax and soak in the
        city's coastal charm.
